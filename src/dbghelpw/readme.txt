I also commented out some TRACE calls that were cluttering the place up.
Added some NTDLL import libs, brought over casemap.c from wine, and
added some compatibility stubs.

Optimized the dwarf symbol lookup code.
Some changes to support compiling a Wow64 build (64-bit code, using
32-bit definitions), which includes a few changes in the wine winnt.h and friends.

A few other random fixes.
