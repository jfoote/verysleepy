Sleepy uses wxWidgets 2.9.2 currently.

To build wxWidgets:
===================
Run one of the Microsoft batch files to set up Visual Studio:
   cd C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\bin
   vcvars32.bat		// for a regular 32-bit compile
   vcvars64.bat		// for a regular 64-bit build
   vcvarsx86_amd64.bat	// for a 64-bit cross-compile

Now, from the wxWidgets "build\msw" directory:

   nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=debug SHARED=0 RUNTIME_LIBS=static

NMAKE is part of Visual Studio, so vcvars should have added it to your path.

You may need to add a WXWIN environment variable (pointing to the wxWidgets directory),
so that Sleepy knows where you've installed it.

Options
=======
For a release build, use BUILD=release instead
For 64-bit, add TARGET_CPU=AMD64
